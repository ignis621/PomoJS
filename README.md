# PomoJS
PomoJS is a simple pomodoro timer written in vanilla JavaScript. It is designed to be as minimal as possible, while still being functional. It's also designed to be as lightweight as possible, so it can be used on any device.

This project uses
- The [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) (Mocha) color palette
- [Material Product Sounds](https://m2.material.io/design/sound/sound-resources.html) by Google
- Favicon from [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)
